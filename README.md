# Data-Driven Marketing Campaign Analysis and Optimization Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a data-driven approach to analyzing and optimizing marketing campaigns. It uses synthetic marketing campaign data to showcase key steps in the process: data generation, data analysis, visualization, and the generation of actionable optimization proposals.

**Project Goals:**

*   Demonstrate the process of analyzing marketing campaign performance using data.
*   Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) for marketing campaigns (CTR, Conversion Rate, CPA).
*   Visualize campaign performance across different marketing channels.
*   Generate data-driven recommendations to optimize campaign strategy and improve ROI.

**Key Features:**

*   **Synthetic Data Generation:**  Python script (`data_generation/generate_campaign_data.py`) to create realistic, but synthetic, marketing campaign data (CSV format). This data includes information on channels, age groups, locations, impressions, clicks, conversions, and costs.
*   **Comprehensive Data Analysis:** Python script (`data_analysis/analyze_campaign.py`) that performs data analysis to calculate key metrics (CTR, Conversion Rate, CPA), compare channel performance, and generate insightful visualizations (bar charts).
*   **Data Visualization:** Generates visualizations (PNG images) to illustrate campaign performance across channels, making it easy to identify trends and areas for improvement. Visualizations are saved in the `data/analysis_results/` folder.
*   **Optimization Proposal Generation:** Python script (`optimization_proposals/generate_optimization_proposals.py`) that analyzes the campaign data and automatically generates data-driven recommendations for campaign optimization, focusing on channel allocation, landing page improvements, and targeting refinements.
*   **Clear Project Structure:**  Well-organized folder structure for code, data, and outputs, making the project easy to understand and execute.
*   **Detailed README:** This README file provides comprehensive instructions on project setup, execution, and understanding the outputs.

**Technology Stack:**

*   **Programming Language:** Python
*   **Data Analysis and Visualization Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## Technical Requirements

*   **Python 3.x:**  Python must be installed on your system.
*   **Python Libraries:**  Install the required Python libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```

## Project Setup and Execution Instructions

1.  **Clone the GitHub Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd data-driven-marketing-optimization
    ```

2.  **Generate Synthetic Marketing Campaign Data:**
    *   Navigate to the `data_generation` directory: `cd data_generation`
    *   Run the data generation script: `python generate_campaign_data.py`
    *   This script will create a CSV file named `marketing_campaign_data.csv` in the `data/` folder containing synthetic campaign data.

3.  **Analyze Marketing Campaign Data and Generate Visualizations:**
    *   Navigate to the `data_analysis` directory: `cd ../data_analysis` (or `cd path/to/data-driven-marketing-optimization/data_analysis` from project root)
    *   Run the analysis script: `python analyze_campaign.py`
    *   This script will:
        *   Load the `marketing_campaign_data.csv` file from the `data/` folder.
        *   Perform data analysis to calculate key marketing metrics (CTR, Conversion Rate, CPA).
        *   Generate visualizations (PNG images) comparing channel performance and other metrics.
        *   Save the visualizations in the `data/analysis_results/` folder within the `data/` directory.
        *   Print completion messages to the console.

4.  **Generate Optimization Proposals:**
    *   Navigate to the `optimization_proposals` directory: `cd ../optimization_proposals` (or `cd path/to/data-driven-marketing-optimization/optimization_proposals` from project root)
    *   Run the optimization proposal script: `python generate_optimization_proposals.py`
    *   This script will:
        *   Load the `marketing_campaign_data.csv` file.
        *   Analyze the data and identify key performance trends.
        *   Generate data-driven marketing campaign optimization proposals based on the analysis.
        *   Print the optimization proposals to the console.

5.  **View Analysis Results and Visualizations:**
    *   Open the `data/analysis_results/` folder.
    *   You will find PNG image files containing the generated visualizations:
        *   `conversions_by_channel.png`: Bar chart showing total conversions by marketing channel.
        *   `channel_metrics_comparison.png`: Side-by-side bar chart comparing CTR and Conversion Rate by channel.
        *   `cpa_by_channel.png`: Bar chart showing Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) by channel.
    *   Review these visualizations to understand campaign performance across different channels.

6.  **Review Optimization Proposals:**
    *   Read the output printed to the console when you ran `generate_optimization_proposals.py`.
    *   These proposals provide data-backed recommendations for improving your marketing campaign strategy.
